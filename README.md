# Pandas-DataFrame-Plotter

This project aims to extend the built-in `.plot()` function of pandas DataFrames. I am working to slowly integrate these features into pandas with git pulls, but I thought I would put the full feature set on github while I work through that process. Pandas v0.20.0 includes the following git pulls:

1. [ENH: Add the ability to have a separate title for each subplot when plotting](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/14753)

Please look at the [*dataframe_plotter demo.ipynb*](https://github.com/bmagnusson/Pandas-DataFrame-Plotter/blob/master/dataframe_plotter%20demo.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook in this repo to see the full set of features.
